# HoneyPlus

> Goal: Create a configuration for [NathanWolf's Magic plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/) this is a config for a server with friends so, i want to do tests with it, also this is heavily inspired by [PotterPlus](https://github.com/PotterPlus/PotterPlus/).

This config is recommended to use in: **Paper 1.18.2**

*Also this is a test config for play with my friends, so dont use this if you want to use it "oficially or for commercial uses"*
