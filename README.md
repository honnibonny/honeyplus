> Goal: Create a plugin addon for [NathanWolf's Magic plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/) this is a plugin for a server with friends so, i want to do tests with it, also this is inspired by [Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://floonetwork.gumroad.com/l/floomap/).

This plugin is recommended to use in: **Paper 1.18.2**

*Also this is a test plugin for play with my friends, so is not recommended to use this if you want to use it "oficially or for commercial uses"*
